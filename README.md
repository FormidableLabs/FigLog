## Overview

The FigLog widget works with both Figma and FigJam files and can be used solo or with a team. Simply drag a new FigLog widget to the canvas and get started customizing and adding your updates. New changelogs can be added by any user that has edit access to the file the widget is used in.

We hope FigLog becomes a useful tool for you as a way of documenting the evolution of your work and the decisions and context around those updates.
