# FigLog

**FigLog is the easiest and most efficient way to document team decisions and the evolution of your changes in Figma.**

The **FigLog** widget works with both Figma and FigJam files and can be used solo or with a team. Simply drag a new **FigLog** widget to the canvas and get started customizing and adding your updates. New changelogs can be added by any user that has edit access to the file the widget is used in. Changelogs can be edited and deleted only by the original user who created them.

We hope **FigLog** becomes a useful tool for you as a way of documenting the evolution of your work and the decisions and context around those updates.
